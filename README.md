### A Quick access to your favourite sites

## Description
This is a web home page that I am developing.
The reason to use this is for quick and easy access to several of the most popular sites. There will also be more features and updates coming as I learn new things about front-end, and web development.
This was made using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I had not used JS before this hense the tiny amount of it that is used. 

## How-To-Open
*First, make a folder to store all the attached files in. You can  name this something like HOMEPAGE
*Download the files off the github to your new folder
*Double click to open the folder that you made
*Double click the NewWebsite folder
*Double click the home.html file
*Congrats yu have opened it
The file path if you followed this should be: /HOMEPAGE/HOMEPAGE/NewWebsite/home.html

## About-Me
I am a highschool back-end dev and game dev who decided to fuck around with web dev and find out.
I havent made many websites before this. Last time I had made a website before this with raw code was over a year ago. Obviously I had used website makers but I had little experience with raw html.
If you enjoy this or find it helpful that is awesome! I am mainly using this to develop skills and build up my future portfolio.

## TL:DR
I'm new so don't judge this is just a site with cool features.
